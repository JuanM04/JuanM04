## Download Office

There are lots of versions of Office. You can find newer ones [here]() and see their differences [here](). These are my go-to downloads:

- [Office 365 ProPlus (English) x64](https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?ProductreleaseID=O365ProPlusRetail&platform=x64&language=en-us&version=O16GA)
- [Office 365 ProPlus (Spanish - Mexico) x64](https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?ProductreleaseID=O365ProPlusRetail&platform=x64&language=es-mx&version=O16GA)
- [Office 365 ProPlus (Spanish - Mexico) x86](https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?ProductreleaseID=O365ProPlusRetail&platform=x86&language=es-mx&version=O16GA)

## Installation

Open the `.img` file and run the `Setup.exe`. Once installed, you can unmount the setup safely.

## Activation

You can use an official key or an activator.

> **Warning**: some people may recommend buying cheap keys elsewhere. This is not recommended, as these are grey-market keys, gathered from MSDN channels, each key sold multiple times ([extra reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/b7jolc/comment/ejshgai/)). You're not buying directly from MS so you're not buying a license, you're just buying a key and living on the promise that MS won't discover and deactivate it.

If you don't have a key, you can use [Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS)](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/releases/latest). You can also run `irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex` in the PowerShell.

Once opened, go to `Office`, then activate only Office. Once you finished that, enable the auto-renewal.
