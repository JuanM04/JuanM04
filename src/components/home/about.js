    <p>
      My name is Juan Mart√≠n Seery. I was born in 2004 in Argentina. I started
      programming at the age of 12 doing basic HTML pages, and slowly focused in
      Backend. Nowadays, I do small projects in my free time.
    </p>

      I'm good at JavaScript (React, Next.js, Express, Electron), databases
      (SQL, NoSQL), Serverless, Realtime, and GraphQL APIs. I have some
      knowledge about Python, Flutter and Dart, Authentication, and Arduino.
