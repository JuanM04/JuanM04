title: "Day 3 â€” There were problems"
---

> Is has been nearly month between Day 2 and Day 3. Why? Becuase I couldn't play a song and light up the LEDs with a Raspberry Pi Zero. I updated the old posts for a Raspberry Pi 3.

Now, it's time to do some to do an experiment: get a song from Spotify and play it. And that was exactly what I did. Visually, it's not so impresive, but at least works. The code is in [this repo](https://github.com/JuanM04/the-cloc/tree/day-3), in the `day-3` branch. Now, it's time to do some server-things!
