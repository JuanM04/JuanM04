## Download & Installation
You can download the latest ISO [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and you can use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash a USB. If you don't have a key when installing, you can just simply skip the activation step and crack the OS later.

## First Steps
Activating Windows
At the very beginning, you should activate Windows if you haven't done it already. You can achieve this by disabling Windows Defenders' _Real-time protection_, downloading [KMSTools](http://bit.ly/KMS-WSP) and open _KMSAuto Net_ to activate it. Once finished, you should re-enable _Real-time protection_.

### Drivers
So, drivers. I recommend using [Driver Booster](https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php), it's a very good option with a quite easy crack: click _Activate_ and write any of the keys below. Now it's just clicking the _SCAN_ button and then _INSTALL_.

## Installing programs
[Ninite](https://ninite.com/) will help you with that :3. Also, I recommend doing lists with essential programs to install somewhere like [Pastebin](pastebin.com/), so it will be easier to remember what to install.
> **Office**  
> Yes, there are people using Office instead of [Google Docs](docs.google.com/) or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), so let me help you with that. Â¿Remember [KMSTools](http://bit.ly/KMS-WSP)? It can be use to install and activate Office too. Click _Office 20XX Install_, select the programs you need, architecture, language and version, and install them. Finally, activate it.
